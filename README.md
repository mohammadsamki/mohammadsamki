### 🔧 About Me

I’m a dedicated **Full Stack Developer** with 6+ years of experience building real-world systems for international clients (🇨🇦 🇬🇧 🇦🇪 🇯🇴). I started my academic path in **Chemical Engineering** (BAU - 2017) but discovered my true love for coding and problem solving, leading me to pursue a **Computer Engineering Diploma** from **Code Fellows @ LTUC**.

Today, I build powerful, scalable systems using **Django**, **MERN Stack**, and **Flutter** — and teach others to do the same as a **Software Development Trainer** at SDK in Irbid.
